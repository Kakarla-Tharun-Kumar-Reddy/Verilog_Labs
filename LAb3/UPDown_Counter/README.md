### README: Up Counter in Verilog

#### Introduction

This project implements a 4-bit up/down counter in Verilog with loading capabilities. The counter can be configured to count up or down based on the `mode` signal and can be loaded with a specific value. The behavior is verified with a corresponding testbench.

#### Project Structure

- **`up_count` Module**: Implements the 4-bit up/down counter with load functionality.
- **`up_count_tb` Module**: The testbench to verify the functionality of the counter.

#### `up_count` Module

**Functionality**:

- **Inputs**:
  - `clk`: Clock signal.
  - `rst`: Reset signal (active high).
  - `load`: Load signal to load `in` into the counter.
  - `mode`: Mode signal to determine counting direction (1 for up, 0 for down).
  - `in`: 4-bit input data used for loading the counter.

- **Outputs**:
  - `q`: 4-bit output representing the current count of the counter.

**Behavior**:

- **Reset**:
  - When `rst` is high, `q` is reset to 0.
- **Load**:
  - When `load` is high, `q` is set to `in`.
- **Counting**:
  - When `mode` is high, `q` is incremented by 1 on each positive edge of the clock.
  - When `mode` is low, `q` is decremented by 1 on each positive edge of the clock.

**Logic**:

- The counter value is updated on the rising edge of the clock.
- If `rst` is high, `q` is set to 0.
- If `load` is high, `q` is set to `in`.
- If `mode` is high, `q` is incremented by 1.
- If `mode` is low, `q` is decremented by 1.

#### `up_count_tb` Module

**Functionality**:

The testbench applies various input conditions to the `up_count` module to ensure its functionality.

**Test Sequence**:

1. **Clock Generation**:
   - Generate a clock signal with a period of 10 time units.

2. **Reset and Load Operations**:
   - Apply a reset signal to initialize the counter.
   - Apply load and `in` values to set the counter to specific values.
   - Toggle the `mode` signal to test both up and down counting.

**Tasks**:

- **`initialize`**:
  - Initializes the signals to their default values.
- **`reset`**:
  - Applies and deactivates the reset signal.
- **`en_load`**:
  - Sets the `load` signal high.
- **`dis_load`**:
  - Sets the `load` signal low.
- **`inputs`**:
  - Sets the `in` value.
- **`Mode`**:
  - Sets the `mode` signal to determine counting direction.

**Monitoring**:

- The testbench uses `$monitor` to display the values of `rst`, `load`, `mode`, `in`, and `q` to verify the correct operation of the counter.

#### Running the Simulation

1. **Set Up**:
   - Ensure you have a Verilog simulation tool such as Xilinx Vivado or ModelSim installed.
   - Load the `up_count` module and its testbench into the simulation environment.

2. **Compile**:
   - Compile the Verilog files to check for syntax errors.

3. **Run the Testbench**:
   - Execute the testbench to simulate the behavior of the up/down counter.

4. **Verify Outputs**:
   - Check the output `q` and monitor the `rst`, `load`, `mode`, and `in` inputs to ensure the counter increments and decrements correctly, and the load functionality operates as expected.

#### Conclusion

This project provides a 4-bit up/down counter implemented in Verilog, with load functionality and mode control for counting direction. The functionality is verified through various test cases to ensure correct operation.
