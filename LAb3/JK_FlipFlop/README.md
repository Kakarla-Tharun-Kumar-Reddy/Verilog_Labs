### README: JK Flip-Flop with Parameterized Modes in Verilog

#### Introduction

This project implements a JK flip-flop with parameterized modes in Verilog. The JK flip-flop is a versatile sequential logic component that can perform different operations based on the values of its `J` and `K` inputs. The behavior of the flip-flop is controlled by parameters representing various modes of operation.

#### Project Structure

- **`jkff_parameter` Module**: The main module implementing the JK flip-flop with parameterized modes.

#### JK Flip-Flop Functionality

The JK flip-flop operates as follows:

- **Inputs**:
  - `clk`: Clock signal.
  - `rst`: Active-high reset signal.
  - `j`: J input.
  - `k`: K input.

- **Outputs**:
  - `q`: Output of the flip-flop.
  - `qb`: Complement of the output.

**Modes of Operation**:

The behavior of the flip-flop is controlled by the following parameterized modes:

- **MEMORY (2'b00)**: Retains the current value of `q` (no change).
- **SET (2'b10)**: Sets `q` to `1`.
- **RESET (2'b01)**: Resets `q` to `0`.
- **TOGGLE (2'b11)**: Toggles the value of `q` (inverts it).

**Behavior**:

- On the rising edge of the clock (`posedge clk`):
  - If `rst` is high, `q` is set to `0`.
  - Otherwise, the value of `q` is updated based on the `{j, k}` input combination:
    - **MEMORY**: `q` remains unchanged.
    - **RESET**: `q` is set to `0`.
    - **SET**: `q` is set to `1`.
    - **TOGGLE**: `q` is toggled (inverted).

- The complement of the output, `qb`, is computed as `~q`.

#### Implementation Details

- **Parameters**:
  - `MEMORY = 2'b00`: Represents the memory mode.
  - `SET = 2'b10`: Represents the set mode.
  - `RESET = 2'b01`: Represents the reset mode.
  - `TOGGLE = 2'b11`: Represents the toggle mode.

- **`always` Block**:
  - Triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal.
  - Checks the reset condition first. If `rst` is high, `q` is set to `0`.
  - If not in reset, the flip-flop behavior is controlled by the `{j, k}` input combination.

- **`assign` Statement**:
  - `qb` is assigned the complement of `q`.

#### Testbench

The provided module doesn't include a testbench. To fully verify the functionality, you would need to create a testbench that applies various combinations of `j`, `k`, and `rst` to the flip-flop and monitors the output values.

#### Running the Simulation

1. **Set Up**:
   - Ensure you have a Verilog simulation tool such as Xilinx Vivado or ModelSim installed.
   - Load the `jkff_parameter` module into the simulation environment.

2. **Create a Testbench**:
   - Write a testbench to apply various input conditions and observe the behavior of the JK flip-flop.

3. **Run the Simulation**:
   - Compile and run the testbench to verify the functionality of the JK flip-flop with different modes.

4. **Verify Output**:
   - Check the output values of `q` and `qb` to ensure they match the expected results based on the input conditions and parameterized modes.

#### Conclusion

This project provides an implementation of a JK flip-flop with parameterized modes in Verilog. The use of parameters allows for easy configuration of the flip-flop's behavior, making it a versatile component for use in various sequential logic circuits.
