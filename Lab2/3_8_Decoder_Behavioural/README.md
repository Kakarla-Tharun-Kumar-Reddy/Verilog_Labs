### README: 3-to-8 Decoder Using Behavioral Modeling

#### Introduction

This project implements a 3-to-8 decoder using behavioral Verilog modeling. A 3-to-8 decoder is a digital circuit that takes a 3-bit input and activates one of the eight outputs based on the binary value of the input. The decoder is widely used in digital systems to select a specific memory location, register, or any other device connected to one of the multiple outputs.

#### Project Structure

- **`beha3_8deco` Module**: The main module implementing the 3-to-8 decoder using a `case` statement in Verilog.
- **`beha3_8deco_tb` Module**: A testbench module used to simulate and verify the functionality of the 3-to-8 decoder.

#### How It Works

1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - **Inputs**:
     - `a, b, c`: The 3-bit binary input to the decoder.
   - **Output**:
     - `y[7:0]`: An 8-bit output where only one bit is high (1), corresponding to the binary value of the input.

2. **Behavioral Modeling**:
   - The `beha3_8deco` module is implemented using behavioral Verilog, where the output `y` is determined based on the combination of the inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` using a `case` statement.
   - The output `y` is initially set to all zeros (`8'b00000000`). The `case` statement then sets the appropriate output bit to 1 based on the binary value of the inputs.

3. **Operation**:
   - For each possible input combination of `a`, `b`, and `c`, one of the eight output lines `y[7:0]` is set to 1.
   - For example, if the input is `3'b000`, the output will be `8'b00000001`. If the input is `3'b101`, the output will be `8'b00100000`.

#### Simulation and Testing

- The `beha3_8deco_tb` module is used to test the functionality of the 3-to-8 decoder. It applies different input combinations to the decoder and observes the outputs.
- The testbench iterates through all possible combinations of the 3-bit input, ensuring that the decoder correctly activates the corresponding output bit for each input.

#### Running the Simulation

1. **Set Up**:
   - Ensure that you have a Verilog simulation tool such as Xilinx Vivado or ModelSim installed.
   - Load the `beha3_8deco` module and the `beha3_8deco_tb` testbench.

2. **Run the Simulation**:
   - Compile and run the testbench. The simulation should produce output values corresponding to the active output bit based on the input combinations.

3. **Verify Output**:
   - Check the output of the simulation against expected results. For each input combination, verify that the corresponding bit in `y[7:0]` is set to 1, while all other bits remain 0.

#### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of a 3-to-8 decoder using behavioral Verilog modeling. The decoder effectively converts a 3-bit input into an 8-bit output, where only one output bit is high based on the input value. The design is simple yet fundamental in digital systems, providing a basic understanding of decoders and their application in hardware design.
