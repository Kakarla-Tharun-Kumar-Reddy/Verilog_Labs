### README: 4-Bit Ripple Carry Adder

#### Introduction

This project implements a 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder using Verilog. A Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) is a fundamental building block in digital arithmetic, where it adds two binary numbers by "rippling" the carry bit through each full adder stage.

#### Project Structure

- **`ripplem` Module**: The main module that implements the 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder using four instances of a full adder.
- **`ripplem_tb` Module**: A testbench module used to simulate and verify the functionality of the 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder.

#### How It Works

1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - **Inputs**:
     - `a[3:0]`: A 4-bit binary number.
     - `b[3:0]`: Another 4-bit binary number.
     - `cin`: The carry-in bit for the addition.
   - **Outputs**:
     - `s[3:0]`: The 4-bit sum output.
     - `c[3:0]`: The carry bits from each full adder stage.

2. **Ripple Carry Adder**:
   - The Ripple Carry Adder is composed of four full adders connected in series.
   - The carry output from each full adder is connected to the carry input of the next full adder, allowing the carry bit to "ripple" through the entire adder.

3. **Full Adder Module**:
   - Each full adder computes the sum and carry output for a single bit.
   - The final output `s[3:0]` represents the sum of the two input numbers `a` and `b`, and `c[3:0]` represents the carry outputs from each stage.

#### Simulation and Testing

- The `ripplem_tb` module is used to test the functionality of the 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder. It applies different input combinations to the adder and observes the outputs.
- The testbench checks the addition of various 4-bit numbers to verify that the Ripple Carry Adder produces the correct sum and carry outputs.

#### Running the Simulation

1. **Set Up**:
   - Ensure that you have a Verilog simulation tool such as Xilinx Vivado or ModelSim installed.
   - Load the `ripplem` module and the `ripplem_tb` testbench.

2. **Run the Simulation**:
   - Compile and run the testbench. The simulation should produce output values corresponding to the sum and carry outputs for the given input combinations.

3. **Verify Output**:
   - Check the output of the simulation against expected results. The sum output `s[3:0]` should correctly represent the sum of the inputs, and `c[3:0]` should show the carry propagation.

#### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of a 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder, a basic yet essential component in digital circuits. The design adds two 4-bit binary numbers by connecting multiple full adders in series, allowing the carry bit to ripple through the stages and produce the correct sum and carry outputs.
